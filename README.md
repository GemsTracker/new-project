# GemsTracker new project

GemsTracker (GEneric Medical Survey Tracker) is a software package for (complex) distribution of questionnaires and forms during clinical research and quality registrations in healthcare.

This is the GemsTracker quickstart project. You can use it together with the documentation on [GemsTracker.org](https://gemstracker.org) to have a quick start. Check out the [Demo website](https://gemstracker.org/demo/) to give the software a try without even installing it!
